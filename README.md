Bridges
======
It's hard to keep up with people, if your friend changes their phone number, you won’t know. With Bridges you can customize your own contact, add your socials, add your emails, add your nicknames, pronouns, everything. If you change phone numbers, you can change it in the app and it will automatically change for everybody that has you added as a contact, you can also hold your phone near another person’s phone with the app downloaded and simultaneously share your contact with them, no need to sit around and type in information anymore, welcome to the future.
